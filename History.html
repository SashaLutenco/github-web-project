        <p style="color: whitesmoke;"> CSS was made in 1994 by HÃ¥kon Wium Lie in proposal with Tim Berners-Lee who both worked at CERN. Before CSS, Stylesheets existed in the form of DSSL and FOSI, which were not suitable for pulling stylesheets from multiple sources. CSS would help to make this easier for developers. Tim Berners-Lee had been influential in making many versions that were created over the years shortly after like CSS1, CSS2, CSS2.1, and CSS3. Through these versions the development of various features were formed like customizing texts, changing background colors, animations, etc.</p>
