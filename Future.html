        <p style="color: red;">CSS is a programming language that has been used in most common web pages to give the page stylization and also makes it easier to import pictures and other files such as videos, Now in 2020 CSS is being used more to code animations, programmers do this by choosing the timing, function, durations and repetitions. The use of CSS in animation makes for complex animations that can make webpage layouts and other front end interfaces look better and function better</p>
